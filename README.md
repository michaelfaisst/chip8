This is an implementation of an Chip8 emulator in Rust. After starting to learn Rust by doing the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 
2022 challenges, I've read some posts by the wise people of reddit, that implementing a Chip8 emulator would be a good way to learn a language like Rust, 
so here it is!

Due to that, don't expect master level Rust Code, because it definitly isn't.

To implement it I have followed this nice guide from [Tobias Langhoff](https://github.com/tobiasvl):
